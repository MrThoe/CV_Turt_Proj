"""
Import your n_gon file using:
  from n_gon import *

We are going to call the function inside a FOR loop using i as the number of sides (n)
*Don't forget to import turtle and create a Turtle() to be used in this
1.  Add from random import randint
2.  Create a color list: colors = ["Blue", "Green", "Red", "Black", "Yellow", "Purple"]
3.  Can you figure out how to change the colors randomly using this list?
4.  Write a for loop that would change the colors and the size of the squares randomly
5.  Add a turn of some random angle after each statement you call the n-gon.
6.  Make a for loop with 100 random shapea of colors and number of sides?
